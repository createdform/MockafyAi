                    Mockafy empowers developers to create and manage mock data for their applications.
                    It has a simple and intuitive interface that allows users to create mock data in minutes using GPT-3.5

                    Use this as a tool to build a front end without a back end and get management or customer buy-in before you fully commit to building out the back end.
